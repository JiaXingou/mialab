# A Quick Example

## Calculating PSAIA



In order to quickly get started with the PSAIA program, I will demonstrate the entire process using the 1acb.pdb file in data/pdb/ directory as input.

You only need to run the following order:

```
bash main.sh
```

Then, you will get the results in the folder: /result/1acb_result.txt

```
